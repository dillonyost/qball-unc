upf2qso converts a PWSCF UPF pseudopotential file to Qbox xml format.

NOTE: only norm-conserving pseudopotentials can be converted to Qbox
format.  Ultrasoft pseudopotentials are not currently supported by
either Qbox or upf2qso.

Usage:
  upf2qso < C.tpss-mt.UPF > C.tpss-mt.xml

This directory contains executables for some of the LC machines, as
well as source code for compilation on other platforms.

upf2qso was written by Francois Gygi at U.C. Davis.
