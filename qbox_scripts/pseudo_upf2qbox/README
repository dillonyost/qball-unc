upf2qso converts a PWSCF UPF pseudopotential file to Qbox xml format.
Both norm-conserving and ultrasoft potential formats are supported, as
well as potentials with non-linear core corrections.  Note that
ultrasoft and nlcc can only be used with qb@ll, as the open source
Davis version does not currently have these features implemented.

Usage:
  upf2qso < C.tpss-mt.UPF > C.tpss-mt.xml

This directory contains executables for some of the LC machines, as
well as source code for compilation on other platforms.

upf2qso was originally written by Francois Gygi at U.C. Davis. and
later modified by Erik Draeger at LLNL.
